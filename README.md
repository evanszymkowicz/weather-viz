# Weather Visualization

Inspired by React Amsterdam 2018 <br>

Getting a Linter warning. Had to uppercase the file names inside /src/visualizations so that they can be exported as React components. <br>

D3 accesses the DOM on transitions, axes and brushes. <br>
Combining the two to try to wrap a D3 viz with a UI. <br>
